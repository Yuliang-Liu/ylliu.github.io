He has been selected for the National High-Level Talent Special Support Program (Young Top Talent), the CAST Young Talent Promotion Program, and is a recipient of the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award of the China Society of Image and Graphics (CSIG). He is recognized as an AI 2000 Global Artificial Intelligence Scholar (one of 232 scholars from Mainland China) and is listed among Stanford University’s Top 2% Scientists Worldwide. Recipient of ACL 2024 Best Paper Award, the first time in the conference’s 62-year history that a Chinese university as the first affiliation has won this award. He is a member of the VLRLab, led by Professor Xiang Bai.

## Research Interests
His research focuses on Vision-Language Processing, specifically on Document Analysis and Understanding and Large Multimodal Models, with research interests including:
  - General document structured parsing
  - Scene text detection and recognition
  - Document image understanding
  - Visual document reasoning
  - Embodied document agents
  - Ancient script interpretation and philology
  - Safety and authenticity verification of multimodal large model–generated content
  - Visual perception for multimodal large models
  - Image generation based on multimodal large models

He has published numerous influential papers in top-tier journals (10+ papers in TPAMI/IJCV) and leading international conferences, with Best Paper, Oral, Spotlight, and Highlight presentations at CVPR, ACL, and NeurIPS. His top three representative works include arbitrarily shaped scene text spotting (e.g., the ABCNet/SPTS series), oracle bone script decipherment (e.g., the OBSD/P3 series), and large language model–based document understanding (e.g., Monkey series).
